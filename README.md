HOUSING LIST

This was a passion project created during phase two at Dev Bootcamp. It was a CRUD app following restful routing built in Ruby, Sinatra and is hosted on Heroku. 

This webapp was built to be a private housing list for small communities to share housing amoung themselves in order to combat gentrification.

It implements an invite only token system. 

It used both the Google Maps and Twillio API's.

A user is able to post, edit, delete, read a housing listing. 
A user is able to contact the owner of the post through text message. 
The receiver is able to respond to the text message and have it appear in an in app inbox. 
The user is able to see where the listing address is located on a built in map. 
A user is able to generate a special token to allow a friend to sign up for the service.
